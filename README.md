## issues
* In general, jekyll will try to build a full page for every post. I skip that by forcing `permalink: /`. This creates multiple entries in sitemap.xml for index.html but is otherwise fine. 
* If you want multiple paragraphs, consider using `excerpt_separator: <!--more-->` in `_config.yml`, for my own use I didn't need this. 
* My own posts have lots of extra stuff left over from my old jekyll design ("author", long descriptions, etc.), feel free to ignore them
* I use thumbnails, so I can upload arbitrary sized images but then only display small ones. The `_make_thumbnails.sh` script generates them and the html template looks in `tn/` for all images. 
* I have three categories of post with slightly differerent formatting, so changing sizing requires edits in multiple paces.
